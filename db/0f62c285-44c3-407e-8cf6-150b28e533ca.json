Elizabeth Warren\u2019s belief that his company should be broken up. And he seems annoyed by the current political conversation around big tech and privacy.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC\u2019s Becky Quick that aired on Monday, Cook commented on growing calls to break up big tech companies, including Apple. He said he is \u201cfrustrated that tech is painted as monolithic\u201d and said that beyond Apple\u2019s geographic location and market cap, it has little in common with corporations such as Google and Facebook on issues like data privacy and competition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would call us a monopoly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also responded to complaints from iOS app developers that Apple unfairly discriminates against apps from third-party developers and prioritizes its own products instead.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get wrapped up in a pretzel about saying, \u2018No, that doesn\u2019t go on our platform. No, that app doesn\u2019t work, and therefore it\u2019s not going in the App Store,\u2019\u201d Cook said. \u201cI know that that has opened us up for criticism. But it\u2019s a part of being a shop owner or whatever. You know \u2026 if you own a shop on the corner, you decide what goes in your store.\u201d\n\nApple, like many tech companies, has come under increased scrutiny over its size and potential anti-competitive behaviors. Warren in March rolled out a plan calling for the breakup of tech giants, including Apple as well as Google, Amazon, and Facebook. She and others have specifically focused on Apple\u2019s App Store, arguing that Apple shouldn\u2019t be able to run the platform and compete in it with apps of its own.\n\n\u201cYou can be the umpire in a baseball game or you can have a team in the game,\u201d Warren said during a CNN town hall in April. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get to be the umpire and have a team in the game.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Cook has argued that Apple isn\u2019t anti-competitive \u2014 and that it\u2019s very different from the other companies in the tech space. He made a similar point when interviewed by Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher and MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes last year. \u201cI think everybody needs to understand Silicon Valley is not monolithic,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nHe has also tried to separate Apple from other tech companies in the privacy conversation. He has criticized Facebook for its privacy practices and sought to clarify that Apple\u2019s business model is very different from others that monetize its customers\u2019 data. \u201cWe don\u2019t traffic in your data,\u201d Cook told Quick. \u201cWe very much are on your side.\u201d\n\nNot everybody is in love with Apple running the App Store and creating apps\n\nOne of the major antitrust criticisms of Apple centers on its App Store and concerns that it prioritizes its own apps over those of third-party developers and therefore harms competition.\n\nIn March, the music streaming service Spotify filed a complaint against Apple in Europe alleging that the iPhone maker unfairly stifles competition by imposing a \u201ctax\u201d on digital subscription services made by its rivals and otherwise seeks to advantage its own products over those made by others. Dutch enforcers have started investigating whether Apple was promoting its own apps over those of competitors. The cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in Russia. The New York Times recently reported that Apple has targeted 11 of the 17 most downloaded apps meant to help users cut down on screen time or help parents monitor what their children are doing on their devices. (Apple has said it\u2019s done so in the name of security.)\n\nWarren has brought up Apple\u2019s App Store as well.\n\n\u201cApple, you\u2019ve got to break it apart from their App Store. It\u2019s got to be one or the other. Either they run the platform or they play in the store,\u201d she told The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to do both at the same time.\u201d\n\nHer issue with Apple is similar to the criticisms she\u2019s offered of Google and Amazon: These companies get a competitive advantage in the search results on their platform and can prioritize their products over those made by third parties.\n\nThe Supreme Court is currently weighing a court case regarding potential anti-competitive practices relating to the Apple Store. The case, Apple v. Pepper, originated in 2011 after a group of iPhone owners claimed that Apple keeping third-party apps out of its App Store was driving up prices and hurting competition.\n\nThe Verge\u2019s Adi Robertson laid out the case last year:\n\nThe central dispute is relatively simple: Apple only allows iOS users to install apps through its App Store. Any third-party stores require jailbreaking your phone and voiding the warranty. Apple also takes a 30 percent commission on apps that are sold through the App Store. Pepper\u2019s complaint concludes that developers are logically passing that cost along to consumers.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments on that matter last year.\n\nApple says its closed ecosystem isn\u2019t a monopoly. \u201cWe have 15 percent share in the world on smartphones and 8 or 9 on personal computers, and so on and so forth,\u201d Cook told Quick in the CNBC interview. \u201cAnd so the share is clearly not a dominant kind of company, our dominant market.\u201d\n\nWorries about big tech aren\u2019t going anywhere\n\nCook\u2019s efforts to downplay criticisms of Apple and set it apart from others in terms of privacy practices show he\u2019s aware of the conversation going on about the company. Whatever he believes the merits of the critiques are, they\u2019re increasingly becoming part of the narrative around Apple \u2014 and technology in general.\n\nApple has for a long time been beating the drum about it being better than the other tech giants on privacy, as Recode\u2019s Peter Kafka noted last year. Steve Jobs in 2010 separated Apple\u2019s practices from Google\u2019s in an interview in 2010, and Cook has criticized both Google and Facebook on multiple occasions. As privacy concerns have seeped further into the public discussion, Apple has upped its efforts to emphasize that it\u2019s different. \u201cPrivacy to us is a human right,\u201d Cook told Swisher and Hayes last year.\n\nThe conversation about the implications of Big Tech, including when it comes to privacy and competition, isn\u2019t going anywhere. If anything, it\u2019s likely to ramp up. Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias recently did a deep dive into calls to break up Big Tech, including Apple, and explained what\u2019s going on:\n\n[I]n recent years, US regulators have taken an optimistic view of Big Tech\u2019s relentless growth \u2014 seeing a world of improving smartphone quality, free online services, and cheap e-commerce as evidence that competitive markets are working as intended. At the same time, big technology companies have been brutalizing suppliers and competitors (and, not irrelevantly, publishers of journalism) with a range of questionable tactics \u2014 including Amazon\u2019s price wars against competitors, Apple\u2019s high-handed management of its own App Store, and Facebook\u2019s long parade of privacy scandals. As the rich get richer, the criticism has become more intense.\n\nIn other words, this is likely not the last we\u2019ll hear from Cook on the issue.", "_id": "0f62c285-44c3-407e-8cf6-150b28e533ca"}
