Following a sit-in protesting retaliation last month, Googlers are making four demands.\n\n\u201cGoogle seems to have lost its mooring, and trust between workers and the company is deeply broken,\u201d Google walkout organizers wrote on Medium today. \u201cAs the company progresses from crisis to crisis, it is clear Google management is failing, along with HR. It\u2019s time to put HR on a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) and bring in someone we trust to supervise it. It\u2019s time to escalate.\u201d\n\nThe first demand is for Google to meet the rest of the demands of the walkout. While Google did make some changes post-walkout, the company did not address all of the organizers\u2019 demands. For example, Google failed to elevate its chief diversity officer to report directly to Pichai and also ignored the organizers\u2019 request to add an employee representative to the board of directors.\n\nEmployees also want Alphabet CEO Larry Page to intervene and address the demands of the walkout.\n\n\u201cLarry controls Alphabet\u2019s board and has the individual authority to make changes, where others do not,\u201d the organizers wrote.\n\nAdditionally, employees are demanding Google unblock Meredith Whittaker\u2019s transfer and let Claire Stapleton transfer to a new team. Whittaker, the lead of Google\u2019s Open Research and one of the organizers of the walkout, said her role was \u201cchanged dramatically\u201d while fellow walkout organizer Claire Stapleton said her manager told her she would be demoted and lose half of her reports.\n\n\u201cWe call on Google to unblock Meredith\u2019s transfer, and allow her to continue her work as before, fully funded and supported, and to allow Claire to transfer to a new team without continued retaliation and interference,\u201d Googlers wrote.\n\nLastly, they want a transparent and open investigation of human resources and how it handles employee complaints. That\u2019s because they say Google\u2019s HR department is broken.\n\n\u201cOver and over again it prioritizes the company and the reputation of abusers and harassers over their victims,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe collateral damage is all around us. Time is up. We need third party investigators. Even Uber did this, bringing in Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington.\u201d\n\nAmidst scandals at Uber pertaining to sexual harassment, the company brought in an outside team to investigate the company\u2019s culture. That\u2019s what Googlers are now asking for. They want the investigators not to have any financial relationship with Google or Alphabet.\n\nGoogle declined to comment but pointed to its previous statement regarding retaliation:", "_id": "158b4b10-11bc-4fcf-b682-c1d5daa5e1dc"}
