This keeps us in the game.\u201d\n\nGM Canada\u2019s announcement today is good news for our auto workers in Oshawa. I\u2019d like to congratulate & thank @JerryPDias for his tireless efforts to protect these jobs. There\u2019s more work to do to support our workers, and we will never stop fighting for them & their families. \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) May 8, 2019\n\nGM is aiming to shift its focus toward electric vehicles and self-driving cars and away from sedans such as the Chevrolet Impala, which was produced at the Oshawa plant. The automaker has already invested significant sums into engineering for such vehicles in Ontario.\n\n\u201cTying Oshawa into those efforts may be what saves it,\u201d Volpe said. \u201cObviously, the best thing would have been a full reversal of what they announced, but the next best thing is what they announced today.\u201d", "_id": "22c01378-9b48-4f3e-af8b-23b97e181e0a"}
