Not only that, if your company makes the cut, you\u2019ll get the VIP treatment and receive a ton of media and investor attention. Sounds great, right? You bet. Gotta be a catch, right? Wrong.\n\nThe only thing you need to do is apply to be a TC Top Pick.\n\nThe application is super quick and easy, but the selection process is very competitive. Highly discerning TechCrunch editors will review every application. They\u2019ll select up to five startups to represent each of these categories: AI/Machine Learning, Biotech/Healthtech, Blockchain, Fintech, Mobility, Privacy/Security, Retail/E-commerce, Robotics/IoT/Hardware, SaaS and Social Impact & Education.\n\nTC Top Pick designees receive a free Startup Alley Exhibition package that includes one full day of exhibiting alongside hundreds of startups in Startup Alley, our expo hall of opportunity. They also receive three Founder passes (good for all three days of the show), use of CrunchMatch \u2014 our investor-to-startup matching platform \u2014 access to the Disrupt SF 2019 press list, invitations to special events at Disrupt SF and a prime location in the Startup Alley.\n\nIn a classic \u201cbut wait, there\u2019s more\u201d moment, a TechCrunch editor will interview each Top Pick live on the Showcase Stage \u2014 and we\u2019ll promote that video across our social media platforms. That kind of media exposure drives opportunity to your startup long after the show closes.\n\nHere\u2019s a real-world example of what a TC Top Picks designation can do for your startup.\n\nUATAG, which stands for \u201cunique authentication tag,\u201d earned a TC Top Pick designation in the Privacy/Security category at Disrupt SF 2018. The startup\u2019s authentication tags are designed to protect high-end luxury goods and other valuable items from forgery and counterfeiting. The unbreakable tags use two levels of security \u2014 the unique way that glass shatters plus blockchain ledger and data records.\n\nTaras Rodtsevych, UATAG\u2019s founder and CEO, said that the connections his team made as a TC Top Pick helped them find local representation in San Francisco, and it also resulted in two very promising leads.\n\n\u201cCurrently we\u2019re conducting negotiations with two major U.S. brands that are interested in our tags,\u201d said Rodtsevych. I can\u2019t disclose them yet, but they\u2019ve already received and are in the process of testing the prototypes. We hope to build and expand on these relationships.\u201d\n\nExhibiting in Startup Alley is an opportunity to make connections with influencers you might not normally meet, and that was certainly true for UATAG.\n\n\u201cWe made valuable contacts in the fashion and logistics industries, and we met potential technical partners interested in becoming our local representatives in the U.S., Japan and Europe,\u201d said Rodtsevych. \u201cWe even found a company that offers different kinds of back-office services \u2014 like accounting, payroll and HR \u2014 that are essential to registering our company in the U.S.\u201d\n\nRemember that Showcase Stage interview we mentioned?\n\n\u201cThe Showcase interview with Greg Kumparak was an exceptional opportunity,\u201d said Rodtsevych. \u201cSo far, that video has earned us 3,500 views on YouTube, 13,600 on Facebook and 12,700 on Twitter. It increased our reputation and made us recognizable worldwide.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s more than one way to grab the spotlight at Disrupt SF. While you\u2019re applying to be a TC Top Pick, why not apply to compete in Startup Battlefield, too?
