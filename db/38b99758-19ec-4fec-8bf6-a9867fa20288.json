His voice, quiet, measured manner and his thoughtful explanations of the law are always enlightening.\n\nI have listened to the first two episodes of the podcast and thoroughly enjoyed them. I have heard Preet speak many times and yet this episode was almost totally new to me. I had never heard the \u201cimposter\u201d theory before, and it made me smile. I have purchased Preet\u2019s book on Audible but have yet to listen to it. I will, for sure!", "_id": "38b99758-19ec-4fec-8bf6-a9867fa20288"}
