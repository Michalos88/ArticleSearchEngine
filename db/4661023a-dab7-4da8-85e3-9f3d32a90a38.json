It and the two other similarly beneficial finalists presented today at Microsoft\u2019s Build developers conference.\n\nThe Imagine Cup brings together winners of many local student competitions around the world with a focus on social good and, of course, Microsoft services like Azure. Last year\u2019s winner was a smart prosthetic forearm that uses a camera in the palm to identify the object it is meant to grasp. (They were on hand today as well, with an improved prototype.)\n\nThe three finalists hailed from the U.K., India, and the U.S.; EasyGlucose was a one-person team from my alma mater UCLA.\n\nEasyGlucose takes advantage of machine learning\u2019s knack for spotting the signal in noisy data, in this case the tiny details of the eye\u2019s iris. It turns out, as creator Brian Chiang explained in his presentation, that the iris\u2019s \u201cridges, crypts, and furrows\u201d hide tiny hints as to their owner\u2019s blood glucose levels.\n\nThese features aren\u2019t the kind of thing you can see with the naked eye (or rather, on the naked eye), but by clipping a macro lens onto a smartphone camera Chiang was able to get a clear enough image that his computer vision algorithms were able to analyze them.\n\nThe resulting blood glucose measurement is significantly better than any non-invasive measure and more than good enough to serve in place of the most common method used by diabetics: stabbing themselves with a needle every couple hours. Currently EasyGlucose gets within 7 percent of the pinprick method, well above what\u2019s needed for \u201cclinical accuracy,\u201d and Chiang is working on closing that gap. No doubt this innovation will be welcomed warmly by the community, as well as the low cost: $10 for the lens adapter, and $20 per month for continued support via the app.\n\nIt\u2019s not a home run, or not just yet: Naturally, a technology like this can\u2019t go straight from the lab (or in this case the dorm) to global deployment. It needs FDA approval first, though it likely won\u2019t have as protracted a review period as, say, a new cancer treatment or surgical device. In the meantime, EasyGlucose has a patent pending, so no one can eat its lunch while it navigates the red tape.\n\nAs the winner, Chiang gets $100,000, plus $50,000 in Azure credit, plus the coveted one-on-one mentoring session with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nThe other two Imagine Cup finalists also used computer vision (among other things) in service of social good.\n\nCaeli is taking on the issue of air pollution by producing custom high-performance air filter masks intended for people with chronic respiratory conditions who have to live in polluted areas. This is a serious problem in many places that cheap or off-the-shelf filters can\u2019t really solve.\n\nIt uses your phone\u2019s front-facing camera to scan your face and pick the mask shape that makes the best seal against your face. What\u2019s the point of a high-tech filter if the unwanted particles just creep in the sides?\n\nPart of the mask is a custom-designed compact nebulizer for anyone who needs medication delivered in mist form, for example someone with asthma. The medicine is delivered automatically according to the dosage and schedule set in the app \u2014 which also tracks pollution levels in the area so the user can avoid hot zones.\n\nFinderr is an interesting solution to the problem of visually impaired people being unable to find items they\u2019ve left around their home. By using a custom camera and computer vision algorithm, the service watches the home and tracks the placement of everyday items: keys, bags, groceries, and so on. Just don\u2019t lose your phone, since you\u2019ll need that to find the other stuff.\n\nYou call up the app and tell it (by speaking) what you\u2019re looking for, then the phone\u2019s camera it determines your location relative to the item you\u2019re looking for, giving you audio feedback that guides you to it in a sort of \u201cgetting warmer\u201d style, and a big visual indicator for those who can see it.\n\nAfter their presentations, I asked the creators a few questions about upcoming challenges, since as is usual in the Imagine Cup, these companies are extremely early stage.\n\nRight now EasyGlucose is working well but Chiang emphasized that the model still needs lots more data and testing across multiple demographics. It\u2019s trained on 15,000 eye images but many more will be necessary to get the kind of data they\u2019ll need to present to the FDA.\n\nFinderrr recognizes all the images in the widely used ImageNet database, but the team\u2019s Ferdinand Loesch pointed out that others can be added very easily with 100 images to train with. As for the upfront cost, the U.K. offers a 500-pound grant to visually-impaired people for this sort of thing, and they engineered the 360-degree ceiling-mounted camera to minimize the number needed to cover the home.\n\nCaeli noted that the nebulizer, which really is a medical device in its own right, is capable of being sold and promoted on its own, perhaps licensed to medical device manufacturers. There are other smart masks coming out, but he had a pretty low opinion of them (not strange in a competitor but there isn\u2019t some big market leader they need to dethrone). He also pointed out that in the target market of India (from which they plan to expand later) isn\u2019t as difficult to get insurance to cover this kind of thing.\n\nWhile these are early-stage companies, they aren\u2019t hobbies \u2014 though admittedly many of their founders are working on them between classes. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear more about them and others from Imagine Cup pulling in funding and hiring in the next year.", "_id": "4661023a-dab7-4da8-85e3-9f3d32a90a38"}
