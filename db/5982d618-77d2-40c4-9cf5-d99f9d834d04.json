Gangsters paying for auto leases with proceeds of crime. A thriving grey market in which Chinese buyers pay people to purchase cars in Vancouver and claim millions of dollars in sales tax refunds.\n\nThose are some of the scenes uncovered by the provincial government\u2019s latest probe into dirty money in the Vancouver area, a city already under scrutiny for the role its casinos played over years as \u201claundromats\u201d and the torrent of foreign cash that fuelled Canada\u2019s most expensive real estate market.\n\n\u201cThis report is disturbing confirmation that money laundering in British Columbia is a problem that goes beyond our casinos,\u201d British Columbia Attorney General David Eby said Tuesday of the latest findings from a report by independent investigator Peter German.\n\nVancouver\u2019s preponderance of supercars has long raised eyebrows. Its University of British Columbia has been called the University of Beautiful Cars for its student-owned fleet of Lamborghinis, Aston Martins and Porsches. At one point, the city of 2.4 million had one of the world\u2019s top-performing Rolls-Royce dealerships. As one dealer quoted by the report puts it, \u201cwe are selling way too many luxury and premium cars for this economy, for what people earn here.\u201d\n\nChina Export Scheme\n\nThe probe\u2019s biggest surprise finding was a booming trade in luxury vehicle exports driven by an arbitrage between the price of high-end cars in Canada versus China. The government described that grey market as \u201cideal\u201d for facilitating trade-based money laundering.\n\nIn the scheme, buyers overseas use a local nominee to purchase a vehicle for immediate export \u2014 a lucrative trade because a luxury car can cost double in China what it does in North America after a markup by manufacturers and taxes. To sweeten the deal, the so-called straw buyer can then claim a sales tax refund because the vehicle was exported. This can amount to as much as 20 per cent of the purchase price on the most expensive car.\n\nWe are selling way too many luxury and premium cars for this economy, for what people earn here Car dealer\n\nNone of that is illegal. \u201cWhere it becomes problematic is how people purchase these vehicles,\u201d said German. \u201cWith cash, with bank drafts anonymously, and so forth.\u201d\n\nThe scheme provides an easy way for illicit money to be placed in the financial system since car dealerships can accept large cash payments and aren\u2019t required to report them, according to the report. \u201cFurthermore, as this trade-based activity involves large dollar sums leaving China, it generally requires the services of an underground banker,\u201d it said.\n\nGrey Market Explosion\n\nThere\u2019s been an explosion in the number of grey market vehicles exported to China \u2014 to over 4,400 in 2018 from less than 100 in 2013, according to the report. During that period, the province refunded almost $85 million (US$63 million) in sales-tax refunds and had to hire more staff to deal with the number of applications.\n\nIn many cases, applicants seeking refunds couldn\u2019t speak English and presented Chinese passports instead of local driver\u2019s licenses, according to the report. One straw buyer sought refunds for more than 25 vehicles. A thousand buyers were linked to a single exporter.\n\nThe probe also investigated money laundering in horse racing, where it didn\u2019t find much cause for concern, and in real estate. The chapters on real estate will be released in the coming days, Eby said. Meanwhile, the government is already preparing plans to more closely regulate the luxury car sector and review the sales-tax refund program, he said.\n\nUnclear Sources\n\nStill, while the latest report cited some clear examples of illicit money in the sector \u2014 such as individuals with criminal records found to be principals of luxury car dealerships \u2014 much of it focused on transactions where the source of funds is unclear but not necessarily illegal.\n\nIt said buyers use multiple, small international wire transfers to different accounts to buy cars \u2014 something that could be explained by China\u2019s capital controls, which limit foreign currency exchanges and withdrawals to US$50,000 a year. The report also cited one dealer describing how foreign students with no credit history and income obtain auto financing based on bank statements showing regular incoming wire transfers \u2014 an issue that may be one of undeclared income or very wealthy parents rather than unequivocal money laundering.\n\nDealers also say customers in recent years have moved away from cash purchases to international payment methods, including wire transfers, WeChat and UnionPay \u2014 a shift that makes it harder to monitor the source of funds, according to one of the investigators.\n\n\u201cThese foreign credit cards are not transparent in any way,\u201d said Doug LePard, a former Vancouver police officer. \u201cThe money is coming from a foreign country. There is no visibility to law enforcement.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "_id": "5982d618-77d2-40c4-9cf5-d99f9d834d04"}
