Drivers in at least eight cities in the US and several in other countries, from England to India, are calling for drivers to shut down their apps for Uber, Lyft, and other ride-sharing apps \u2014 in some areas for two hours; in other cities, such as Los Angeles, for a full 24 hours. In San Francisco, drivers will rally outside Uber\u2019s corporate headquarters at noon. The demands are ones that Uber drivers have been making for a long time \u2014 higher wages, benefits, pricing transparency \u2014 but ahead of Uber\u2019s IPO, represent a bigger problem the company has as it will be pushed to treat its workers better while moving toward profitability. As Shirin Ghaffary writes, \u201cThe flexible, on-demand workforce that was touted as the gig economy\u2019s greatest asset is now its biggest liability.\u201d\n\n[Shirin Ghaffary / Recode]\n\n[Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox?

Some of the most-downloaded social and news apps in the US are a new batch of networks that let neighbors view and chat about local crime. Nextdoor in particular, which is designed to be a network for neighbors to discuss everyday local news and tips, is in reality, as Rani Molla writes, a \u201chotbed for racial stereotyping that\u2019s forced the company to rewrite its software and policies.\u201d Similarly, Citizen and Amazon\u2019s Neighbors app, which is linked to its digital doorbell Ring product, have become social networks that fuel bias and racial profiling. Molla makes the case that these apps can \u201cfuel a vicious cycle of fear and violence,\u201d making Americans feel like crime is getting worse, even though it\u2019s largely been on the decline for the past 25 years.\n\n[Rani Molla / Recode]\n\nGoogle unveiled a new feature at its I/O 2019 conference that automatically transcribes video or audio you play on your phone in real time. It\u2019s an impressive feature that could potentially help the nearly half a million deaf and hard of hearing people around the world, as The Verge\u2019s Chris Welch details. How does it work? Using what Google has called a breakthrough in machine learning speech recognition, the program shows the transcription for audio in a black box that can be moved around on a phone screen. \u201cBuilding for everyone means ensuring that everyone can access our products,\u201d said Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai at the conference. The feature will be built into the accessibility settings in Google\u2019s Android mobile operating software. It remains to be seen, though, just how accurate the tool will end up being.\n\n[Chris Welch / The Verge]\n\nChinese intelligence agents reportedly captured NSA hacking tools, according to cybersecurity research firm Symantec. As the New York Times writes, \u201c[T]he episode is the latest evidence that the United States has lost control of key parts of its cybersecurity arsenal.\u201d Researchers believe that the Chinese captured the code \u201cfrom an NSA attack on their own computers \u2014 like a gunslinger who grabs an enemy\u2019s rifle and starts blasting away.\u201d According to the Times\u2019 reporting, the group that got hold of the sensitive tools is the same one responsible for attacks in the US on \u201cspace, satellite, and nuclear propulsion technology makers.\u201d The episode seems to be a sign of the vulnerabilities of the digital hacking security code.\n\n[Nicole Perlroth, David E.
