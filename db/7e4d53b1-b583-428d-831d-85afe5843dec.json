Not with a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist, but with an overwhelming number of individual donations in response to today\u2019s news. Contribute before midnight,\u201d the note \u2014 signed by Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, and not so subtly digging at Biden\u2019s day-one activities \u2014 asked. \u201cIt would mean A LOT to our campaign.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Sanders\u2019s team sent another note to his backers, updating them on their rival\u2019s progress. \u201cJoe Biden released his first day fundraising numbers,\u201d Shakir wrote. \u201cThe good news: we have a lot more individual donations than him on day one. A lot. The bad news: when their campaign got done counting the checks from a $700,000 fundraiser hosted at the home of a telecommunications lobbyist, he out-raised us by just a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe relative calm of the Democratic primary\u2019s opening four months was over: Sanders was laying out the first publicly stated fault lines between top-tier contenders. That\u2019s because in order to succeed in 2020, he thinks, he needs the fight.\n\nIt\u2019s long been obvious to Sanders\u2019s political advisers and allies that he does best with voters when he has an obvious Establishment foil to both rile him up and sharpen his crusader-for-a-political-revolution pitch, in the form of a \u201cwe\u2019re under attack\u201d message. \u201cHe\u2019s a change candidate \u2014 his core message is he wants to take on the political Establishment and the economic Establishment. He wants to change the political and economic status quo,\u201d explained one senior Democrat close to him. \u201cSo any time he has an opportunity to critique either the political or economic status quo, it\u2019s like, \u2018There you go!\u2019 [because] the fuel driving his candidacy is voters who are unhappy with the status quo. So he\u2019s going to lean into any opportunity to pick that fight.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no better evidence for this than 2016, when he weaponized his disagreements with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee to great effect. But now, facing a bigger, more progressive field, Sanders\u2019s path to actual victory is both more within reach \u2014 by his own team\u2019s estimation, he needs to win something close to 30 percent of voters in the early states \u2014 and vastly more complicated \u2014 he\u2019s short of that mark now, and no longer has just a single, obvious rival with whom he can easily build a one-on-one contrast.\n\nIn the pre-Biden stage of the race, Sanders\u2019s camp took advantage of squabbles with a trio of supposedly powerful antagonists to solidify support among his most loyal followers and try to grow their ranks, rallying them against the liberal Center for American Progress think tank, party donors organizing against him, and Fox News. \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2018He\u2019s not a wilting violet\u2019 theory to all this,\u201d Shakir told me after Sanders\u2019s appearance on a Fox News town hall but before Biden got into the race. \u201cLast time, [Sanders] felt he took some shots. And this time around, he\u2019s going to fight early and fight back.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Sanders is no longer alone at the front of the field, supplanted by the former vice-president \u2014 the presumptive Establishment pick, and the candidate who has worried Sanders most since he first started seriously thinking about 2020, back in January 2018 \u2014 who has not just seen a polling bump but a jolt in the attention primary, too: The week Biden announced his candidacy, he replaced Sanders as the most-mentioned candidate on cable television, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analyses. So Sanders\u2019s imperative has become to draw as stark a contrast as possible with the man who appears to have no interest in fighting back and turning 2020 into a Bernie-versus-the-world 2016 redux. (\u201cThey talk about division in the Democratic Party,\u201d Biden joked in Iowa last Tuesday, but \u201cwe agree on basically everything \u2014 all 400 of us.\u201d)\n\nThis is a space where Sanders is supremely comfortable, and if his calculations are right, it should lay a groundwork for his climb toward the magic 30 percent mark. \u201cOne of the biggest dangers for Bernie going into this cycle was he would become the de facto front-runner, and the de facto institutional candidate. And I think with Biden\u2019s candidacy and some other factors, he may legitimately be in a position to run as an outsider again, but with all the advantages of a front-runner,\u201d said Robby Mook, who managed Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good deal.\u201d\n\nBut if Sanders\u2019s expectation is off the mark, and his numbers keep slipping, it may because Democratic primary voters beyond his core supporters are eager for something other than a litigation of these contrasts, in an election they\u2019re desperate to win.\n\nSanders\u2019s campaign treated his appearance on a Fox News town hall in Pennsylvania last month as a test case for using his battles to grow his coalition. During the event, he repeatedly pointed out the irony of appearing on Fox News, which has largely been hostile to him, when most other Democrats wouldn\u2019t. His advisers were wagering that the contentious event pitting Sanders against the \u201ccorporate media\u201d would generate gangbusters ratings. It was a good bet: Sanders\u2019s appearance was the highest-rated candidate town hall yet.\n\nThat hour of programming wasn\u2019t just about projecting his ideas to a wider audience than usual, though: Sanders\u2019s team has been conscious of using his fights \u2014 his big moments in the national spotlight \u2014 to prove he is electable in a general election, which they regard as a major obstacle in the primary. They had a feeling Donald Trump himself would be watching Fox News that night, according to a Sanders adviser, and the president indeed tweeted about the event when it was done, thereby granting Sanders\u2019s wish of setting up a direct Trump-versus-Bernie matchup in voters\u2019 minds. (Within days, Sanders\u2019s campaign sought to hammer this particular message home: Its pollster circulated internal polling numbers showing his candidate topping the president in a hypothetical general election contest in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.)\n\nStill, that performance was a welcome break for Sanders from a public disagreement whose resolution was less obviously an immediate boon for his candidacy. After ThinkProgress, which is affiliated with the Center for American Progress \u2014 a prominent Democratic think tank with close ties to the Clintons, including through its founder John Podesta and president Neera Tanden \u2014 published a video critical of Sanders, the senator instructed his staff to send CAP a letter asking it to back off, and before long, the campaign was raising money off the disagreement \u2014 it called the group \u201cthe epitome of the political Establishment.\u201d But a fight with even an influential D.C. think tank was hardly the clear-cut galvanizer some in Sanders\u2019s camp expected, especially given the complex history between the two sides \u2014 Shakir once worked at CAP, and Sanders himself spoke at one of its conferences last year. Within a few days, two of Sanders\u2019s closest aides \u2014 senior adviser Jeff Weaver and Ari Rabin-Havt, the campaign chief of staff \u2014 secretly met with CAP leadership to cool tensions, multiple Democrats briefed on the meeting confirmed to New York. (\u201cAt this point, we fully believe that CAP is fully committed, as a priority, to defeating Donald Trump, and we are fully united in this goal,\u201d Rabin-Havt told me a few days later.)\n\nThis was just as well. There was, by then, another easy contrast to draw, courtesy of a New York Times headline \u2014 \u201c\u2018Stop Sanders\u2019 Democrats Are Agonizing Over His Momentum\u201d \u2014 that the campaign clipped and circulated in yet another email: \u201cI am writing to ask for your help countering a serious threat to our campaign,\u201d it wrote, playing into Sanders\u2019s wheelhouse \u2014 an opportunity to rail against Establishment donors organizing in secret against him. \u201cThe last two weeks summarize everything that is Bernie,\u201d one of his aides told me at the time. He was only eight points behind Biden in Morning Consult\u2019s national tracking poll.\n\nBut just few weeks later, that gap is now 21 points. In New Hampshire, the state he won easily and needs to propel him to victory this time, he is now eight points behind Biden, and tied with Pete Buttigieg, if a recent Suffolk/Boston Globe survey is to be believed. That leaves him at 12 percent of support \u2014 far below the 30 or so his team thinks he needs.\n\nNot that Sanders is recalculating. Last Monday, Biden debuted on the campaign trail, rallying union workers in Pittsburgh. And there, on CNN that night, was Sanders. \u201cI helped lead the fight against NAFTA, he voted for NAFTA. I helped lead the fight against PNTR with China, he voted for it,\u201d the senator told Anderson Cooper. \u201cI strongly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he supported it. I voted against the war in Iraq, he voted for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s core to what we do, it\u2019s part of the brand,\u201d Shakir told me. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to take away that he\u2019s searching for these types of fights,\u201d he explained of his boss. But it\u2019s true that \u201ceven when things start to change, he very much sees an array of people who are stacked against him, very clearly.\u201d", "_id": "7e4d53b1-b583-428d-831d-85afe5843dec"}
