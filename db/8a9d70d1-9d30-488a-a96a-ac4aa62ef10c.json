But you wouldn\u2019t know that from a crop of increasingly popular social media apps that are forming around crime.\n\nApps like Nextdoor, Citizen, and Amazon Ring\u2019s Neighbors \u2014 all of which allow users to view local crime in real time and discuss it with people nearby \u2014 are some of the most downloaded social and news apps in the US, according to rankings from the App Store and Google Play.\n\nNextdoor bills itself as the \u201cworld\u2019s largest social network for the neighborhood,\u201d where you can ask for nearby restaurant recommendations, buy used furniture, or report a stolen bike. In practice, its \u201ccrime and safety\u201d section has been a hotbed for racial stereotyping that\u2019s forced the company to rewrite its software and policies.\n\nCitizen \u2014 whose previous form was called Vigilante and which appeared to encourage users to stop crimes in action \u2014 sends users 9-1-1 alerts for crimes happening nearby. It also allows users to livestream footage they record of the crime scene, \u201cchat with other Citizen users as situations develop\u201d and \u201cbuild out your Inner Circle of family and friends to create your own personal safety network, and receive alerts whenever they\u2019re close to danger.\u201d\n\nNow Amazon has thrown its hat in the ring \u2014 with Ring. It recently advertised an editorial position that would coordinate news coverage on crime, specifically based around its Ring video doorbell and Neighbors, its attendant social media app. Neighbors alerts users to local crime news from \u201cunconfirmed sources\u201d and is full of Amazon Ring videos of people stealing Amazon packages and \u201csuspicious\u201d brown people on porches. \u201cNeighbors is more than an app, it\u2019s the power of your community coming together to keep you safe and informed,\u201d it boasts.\n\nNextdoor was the ninth most-downloaded lifestyle app in the US on iPhones at the end of April, according to App Annie, a mobile data and analytics provider; that\u2019s up from No. 27 a year ago in the social networking category. (Nextdoor changed its app category from social to lifestyle on April 30; on April 29 it was ranked 14th in social, according to App Annie.) Amazon Ring\u2019s Neighbors is the 36th most-downloaded social app. When it launched last year, it was 115th. Citizen, which considers itself a news app, was the seventh most-downloaded news app on iOS at the end of April, up from ninth last year and 29th in 2017.\n\nApps can fuel a vicious cycle of fear and violence\n\nThese apps have become popular because of \u2014 and have aggravated \u2014 the false sense that danger is on the rise. Americans seem to think crime is getting worse, according to data from both Gallup and Pew Research Center. In fact, crime has fallen steeply in the last 25 years according to both the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nOf course, unjustified fear, nosy neighbors, and the neighborhood watch are nothing new. But the proliferation of smart homes and smart devices is putting tools like cameras and sensors in doorbells, porches, and hallways across America.\n\nAnd as with all things technology, the reporting and sharing of the information these devices gather is easier than it used to be and its reach is wider.\n\nThese apps foment fear around crime, which feeds into existing biases and racism and largely reinforces stereotypes around skin color, according to David Ewoldsen, professor of media and information at Michigan State University.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very deep research saying if we hear about or read a crime story, we\u2019re much more likely to identify a black person than a white person [as the perpetrator],\u201d Ewoldsen said, regardless of who actually committed the crime.\n\nAs Steven Renderos, senior campaigns director at the Center for Media Justice, put it, \u201cThese apps are not the definitive guides to crime in a neighborhood \u2014 it is merely a reflection of people\u2019s own bias, which criminalizes people of color, the unhoused, and other marginalized communities.\u201d\n\nExamples abound of racism on these types of apps, usually in the form of who is identified as criminal.\n\nA recent Motherboard article found that the majority of people posted as \u201csuspicious\u201d on Neighbors in a gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood were people of color.\n\nNextdoor has been plagued by this sort of stereotyping.\n\nCitizen is full of comments speculating on the race of people in 9-1-1 alerts.\n\nWhile being called \u201csuspicious\u201d isn\u2019t of itself immediately harmful, the repercussions of that designation can be. People of color are not only more likely to be presumed criminals, they are also more likely to be arrested, abused, or killed by law enforcement, which in turn reinforces the idea that these people are criminals in the first place.\n\n\u201cThese apps can lead to actual contact between people of color and the police, leading to arrests, incarceration and other violent interactions that build on biased policing practices by law enforcement agencies across the country,\u201d Renderos said. \u201cAnd in the digital age, as police departments shift towards \u2018data-driven policing\u2019 programs, the data generated from these interactions including 9-1-1 calls and arrests are parts of the historic crime data often used by predictive policing algorithms. So the biases baked in to the decisions around who is suspicious and who is arrested for a crime ends up informing future policing priorities and continuing the cycle of discrimination.\u201d\n\nApps didn\u2019t create bias or unfair policing, but they can exacerbate it\n\n\u201cTo me, the danger with these apps is it puts the power in the hands of the individual to decide who does and doesn\u2019t belong in a community,\u201d Renderos said. \u201cThat increases the potential for communities of color to come in contact with police. Those types of interactions have wielded deadly results in the past.\n\n\u201cLook what happened to Trayvon Martin. George Zimmerman was the watchdog. He saw someone who looked out of place and decided to do something about it.\u201d\n\nThese apps can also be psychologically detrimental to the people who use them.\n\nIt\u2019s natural for people to want to know more about the world around them in order to decrease their uncertainty and increase their ability to cope with danger, Ewoldsen said, so people turn to these apps.\n\n\u201cYou go on because you\u2019re afraid and you want to feel more competent, but now you\u2019re seeing crime you didn\u2019t know about,\u201d Ewoldsen said. \u201cThe long-term implication is heightened fear and less of a sense of competence. ... It\u2019s a negative spiral.\u201d\n\n\u201cFocusing on these things you\u2019re interpreting as danger can change your perception of your overall safety,\u201d Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, told Recode. \u201cEssentially you\u2019re elevating your stress level. There\u2019s buckets of research that talks about the dangers of stress, from high blood pressure to decreased mental health.\u201d\n\nThese apps are particularly scary since they\u2019re discussing crime nearby, within your neighborhood or Zip code.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s so close, my guess is it has a bigger impact on fear,\u201d Ewoldsen said.\n\nWhy is this happening now?\n\nTechnology has essentially enabled people to do what they always wished they could: know what\u2019s going on and where the danger is. Security cameras and their associated apps \u2014 like smart devices in general \u2014 are getting better and cheaper, and they\u2019re finding their ways into more and more people\u2019s homes.\n\nEntertainment devices like smart TVs and streaming devices are the biggest segment of smart devices sales, but smart security devices are a close second, according to data from research firm IDC. The smart security segment\u2019s annualized growth rate is expected to be nearly 30 percent for the next three years.\n\nLike all new technology, we\u2019re struggling to use it correctly.\n\n\u201cWhen anything is new, we have a hard time figuring out how to use it,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cWe jump in the deep end of the pool and slowly walk to a place that makes sense.\u201d\n\nBut why would we use something that plays on demonstrably false fears and has so many negative side effects? Some say: evolution.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing ourselves to understand the nature of our environment to increase our chances of survival,\u201d Rutledge told Recode. \u201cOur instinct is to get as much information as possible to figure out what\u2019s a danger.\n\n\u201cWandering around on the savanna, it was much more important to know where tigers are than flowers,\u201d she added.\n\nSo even if you\u2019re statistically safe, the instinct is to look for what could go wrong.\n\n\u201cYou might know that only four out of 10,000 people get congenital heart disease,\u201d Rutledge explained. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve been one of the four that\u2019s not reassuring. Similarly, if in your neighborhood you\u2019re aware of things happening, the fact that crime is down 20 percent is not going to cut the mustard.\u201d\n\nThe issue is compounded by the media, Ewoldsen says.\n\n\u201cIf you see more coverage of crime you think it\u2019s more of an issue, even if real-world statistics say it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ewoldsen said.\n\nAnd all this is happening at a very contentious point in time, both politically and socially.\n\n\u201cSome of this has to do with the general level of discord and lack of comfort societally right now,\u201d Rutledge said.\n\nAs Ewoldsen put it, \u201cThe president screaming about crime all the time \u2014 creating a fake crisis at the border and saying immigrants are stealing jobs, that Mexico and other countries are sending criminals \u2014 is reinforcing the idea that crime is going through the roof.\u201d\n\nThe rise of fear-based social media apps might also have to do with the decline of local news. Cuts to and closings of local newspapers over the past few decades have led to news deserts: areas that no longer have reporters to cover goings-on that aren\u2019t on a national scale.\n\nFor better and usually worse, social media has stepped in to fill the void.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how people are exposed to news today,\u201d Renderos said. \u201cSocial media is increasingly where people identify their source of news.\u201d\n\nThese local social and news apps, with their air of authority and neighborhood-watch ethos, can seem like a good alternative. It\u2019s not as though local news was immune to fear-based coverage, but new technology has the ability to amplify that type of information.\n\nWhat do we do about it?\n\nEwoldsen argues it\u2019s a matter of media literacy and how people choose to consume media.\n\n\u201cWe need to pay attention and to be more mindful in our consumption of the news,\u201d he said.\n\nThat means realizing what posts on these apps are and aren\u2019t relevant to you, perhaps by decreasing the radius for which these apps display crime or by turning off notifications. People also need to be aware of how their biases and those of their fellow app users could skew reporting and the reaction to that reporting.\n\nThe responsibility also falls on the makers of the technology.\n\n\u201cIt would help if they eliminated all unverified reports,\u201d Rutledge said. In practice, however, this would mean having to verify crimes before they could be posted, which would be very difficult if not impossible.\n\n\u201cIt would help if it would say \u2018these are three important geolocated things and these things aren\u2019t important \u2014 these aren\u2019t threats. Here are some tips.\u2019\u201d\n\nCynics might say that these companies are only trying to sell more door cameras and wireless security devices and encourage more app downloads, so breeding fear is in their best interest, but Rutledge thinks the companies should take the long view.\n\n\u201cA sustainable company will want to think about the longterm wellbeing of their customers,\u201d Rutledge said. \u201cAlways going for a quick buck is not going to make you a sustainable company.\u201d\n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing \u2014 and changing us.
