Ever since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced in October 2018 that they were expecting a child \u201cin the spring\u201d, they have shared scant information about their due date, let alone the expected sex of their first child. The baby boy\u2019s arrival even caught some news organisations by surprise, with lunchtime \u201cpush\u201d notifications that the Duchess had gone into labour being followed swiftly by reports that she had given birth many hours earlier. Despite this uncertainty, or perhaps because of it, a number of bookmakers have allowed punters to bet on the royal baby\u2019s arrival date, sex, weight and name.\n\nSo far, the public\u2019s predictive powers have been weak. On Saturday two major bookmakers were giving the chances of a baby girl a 75% likelihood, and just 35% for a boy. (A higher percentage in such a binary market reflects more money being staked on it, and the extra 10% is how bookies make money regardless of the outcome). One gambling firm reports a healthy profit on bets that Ms Markle would give birth in April. And a late flurry of wagers over the weekend on the child\u2019s name saw Diana usurped as the leading contender in favour of Ivy, which at one point had a probability of 41%\u2014a huge prediction given that the sex had not yet been revealed.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nWith all gambling activity now focused on the royal moniker, an industry spokesman estimates that the \u00a3500,000 wagered on the name so far could double by May 8th, when the announcement is expected. Alexander and Spencer are currently the leading contenders at 19%. If the gambling public\u2019s predictions so far are anything to go by, expect another surprise.\n\nMore on the royal family:", "_id": "91f38f9d-dc47-426b-8b65-5c422e7ffa84"}
