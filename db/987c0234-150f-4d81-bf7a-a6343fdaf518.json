Prosecutors said the administrators made their commission by linking to marketplaces on the dark web \u2014 only accessible through Tor, an encrypted anonymity network.\n\nMany of the dark web marketplaces sold drugs, weapons and stolen data, which hackers could use to break into online accounts.\n\nA staffer at Deep Dot Web said in a Medium post following the arrests that Deep Dot Web would generate a slice of the revenue from purchases made on dark web marketplaces, said to be as much as 4 percent. Brazil\u2019s federal police said in a statement the site made millions in dollars in cryptocurrency from referral sales from more than 15,000 dark web users.\n\nFollowing the arrests, the FBI seized Deep Dot Web\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cIt was truly a 50:50 partnership between the two defendants,\u201d said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for Western Philadelphia, in a press conference in Pittsburg on Wednesday announcing the charges.\n\nAccording to the district attorney, more than 23 percent of all transactions made on AlphaBay, a dark web marketplace taken down by authorities in 2017, were associated with a referral link from Deep Dot Web. The indictment also said Deep Dot Web referred over 198,000 users to Hansa, another defunct market, accounting for nearly half of the site\u2019s users, of which Deep Dot Web \u201creceived a commission on all of those users\u2019 purchases.\u201d\n\nThe indictment said Prihar and Phan made about 8,155 bitcoins in total \u2014 almost half of which was collected from AlphaBay. Prosecutors said at its peak, the bitcoins were worth more than $15.4 million.\n\n\u201cThis is the single most significant law enforcement disruption of the dark net to date,\u201d said Brady.", "_id": "987c0234-150f-4d81-bf7a-a6343fdaf518"}
