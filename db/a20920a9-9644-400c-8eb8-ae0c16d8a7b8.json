This 30-second snippet is more about setting the mood, starting with a slow pan up the side of a building, a fluttering cape, and a quick look at the iconic Bat Signal.\n\nThen we see our hero turn and face the camera and... boom. Meet Batwoman. We don't know when she'll be here, but the teaser promises that she's \"coming soon.\"", "_id": "a20920a9-9644-400c-8eb8-ae0c16d8a7b8"}
