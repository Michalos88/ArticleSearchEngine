According to sources, Amazon has been proposing deals that would give publishers advance money to expand their international online presence, specifically for consumer-oriented shopping sites. It\u2019s a deal that Amazon is interested in because it\u2019s looking to bring new shoppers to the company who click on \u201caffiliate links\u201d embedded on publishers\u2019 websites. As Peter Kafka writes, \u201cIf any of the deals get finalized, they will mark a new chapter for Amazon,\u201d as it will be the first time the company has \u201cpaid publishers in advance to make specific kinds of videos or other content\u201d \u2014 as well as \u201can indicator that even though Amazon dominates online commerce, it still thinks it needs help getting shoppers inside its giant site.\u201d It\u2019s not known how much Amazon is considering paying publishers, \u201cthough it\u2019s enough for several publishers to take seriously.\u201d\n\n[Peter Kafka / Recode]\n\n[Want to get the Recode Daily in your inbox?

In a recent interview on CNBC, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he\u2019s \u201cfrustrated that tech is painted as monolithic\u201d and that his company is different than companies like Google and Facebook. As Emily Stewart writes, \u201cApple has for a long time been beating the drum about it being better than the other tech giants on privacy,\u201d and Cook\u2019s comments show that \u201cApple has upped its efforts to emphasize that it\u2019s different,\u201d especially in light of calls from politicians like Sen. Elizabeth Warren who believe big tech, including Apple, should be broken up. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would call us a monopoly,\u201d said Cook, who made the case that Apple has only a 15 percent share in the world on smart phones and eight or nine percent on personal computers.\n\n[Emily Stewart / Recode]\n\nSeveral lawsuits reveal a pattern of alleged discrimination toward pregnant warehouse workers at Amazon. A new report from CNET examined seven different lawsuits filed by pregnant women who were fired from their jobs at Amazon warehouses over the last eight years. The women reportedly endured limited bathroom breaks and heavy lifting, against their doctors\u2019 advice. \u201cAmazon wants to push out as much product as possible,\u201d said one of the plaintiffs, Beverly Rosales. \u201cThey need as many people that don\u2019t need accommodations to work there. They care more about the numbers than their employees.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, denied the allegations. A spokesperson for the company said that \u201c[i]t is absolutely not true that Amazon would fire any employee for being pregnant; we are an equal opportunity employer.\u201d The company, which employes 600,000 people, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years for its working conditions at its warehouses around the world.\n\n[Alfred Ng and Ben Fox Rubin / CNET]\n\nTwo top senators are urging the FTC to move faster with their investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MT) wrote in a statement that the investigation \u201chas been long delayed in conclusion \u2014 raising the specter of a remedy that is too little too late.\u201d The senators pressed the regulatory agency not to shy away from being tough on Facebook, and called for individual executives at the company to be held accountable if any were found to have knowingly broken the law. They also called a potential fine in the range of billions of dollars a \u201cbargain\u201d for the social giant. Facebook has previously stated that it\u2019s preparing for a fine as high as $5 billion.\n\n[Tony Romm / The Washington Post]\n\nTop Stories from Recode\n\nTristan Harris says tech is \u201cdowngrading\u201d humanity \u2014 but we can fix it.\n\nHarris, previously best known for his association with the Time Well Spent movement, compares the unchecked rise of tech to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d future of climate change.\n\n[Kara Swisher]\n\nThe Facebook free speech battle, explained.\n\nIs Facebook a platform or a publisher?
