But its output is nothing if not consistent. It took more than 24 hours for state media to report President Donald Trump\u2019s threats, tweeted on May 5th, to ratchet up tariffs on China. By that time Chinese stocks had already plunged, a foretaste of global market ructions. When the response finally came in official editorials, it was a familiar refrain from China\u2019s canon of trade-war statements: \u201cWe do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight and, given no choice, we will fight.\u201d\n\nThat sounds bellicose. Yet one lesson from the past year\u2019s dispute with American is that China places more weight on the sentence\u2019s first part, its desire to avoid a full-on fight. At multiple points when the Chinese government could have retaliated against America by targeting its businesses, it has instead tried to win them over, giving them better access to its market.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nDodging a fight, though, does not mean giving in. As The Economist went to press, officials from both countries were meeting in Washington to see whether they could revive a deal which, until Mr Trump\u2019s tweets, had seemed nearly done. According to Reuters, citing American government sources, China had backtracked on pledges to rewrite laws on everything from competition policy to intellectual property. Chinese advisers counter that it is American negotiators who have become inflexible.\n\nThis creates two huge uncertainties for the global economy. One dominates discussion. Will there be a deal or will America raise tariffs? The other receives less attention. Is there a point at which China might lash out against America, even at a cost to itself?\n\nIt is easy to imagine how China could punch back. Given its $380bn trade surplus with America, China is more vulnerable to tariffs. But American businesses, from Apple to General Motors, have big footprints in China. American firms made roughly $200bn more in sales in China in 2015 than Chinese firms did in America, according to Deutsche Bank. The Chinese government could whip up consumer boycotts. It could hold up supplies at customs. It could smother factories with safety inspections.\n\nIn its retaliation, China has already used tariffs to hit sensitive targets. It has pushed soyabean farmers in Iowa and Wisconsin, states that will influence whether Mr Trump can win a second term, to the brink of bankruptcy. But it has largely refrained from deploying the dirtier weapons in its arsenal. After briefly delaying American whiskey shipments at the border last year, Jack Daniel\u2019s is flowing again.\n\nEven more striking are China\u2019s attempts to be emollient. Having long hesitated, it opened the door last year for a range of foreign firms, from carmakers to insurers, to take majority stakes in their Chinese operations. In March it passed a foreign-investment law that, in theory, addresses some big American grievances. It has even undone some tariffs: in December it lifted extra duties that it had imposed on American cars and car parts.\n\nChina\u2019s decision to opt for a relatively conciliatory strategy can be explained in three ways. Most obvious is its desire to minimise the trade war. If America were to slap 25% tariffs on all imports from China, that could knock two percentage points off Chinese growth over the next 12 months, according to UBS, a Swiss bank.\n\nA second factor is China\u2019s play to win back some support in America. Foreign businesses have grown frustrated with China. A more level playing field could change that, especially if China offers evidence of benefits. News on May 8th that JPMorgan Chase, an American bank, might become the first foreign company to own a majority stake in its Chinese mutual-fund business is just the kind of thing.\n\nThe final point is China\u2019s management of domestic opinion. Xi Jinping, the president, is powerful, but he does not want to arm his critics. One government adviser says that left-wing scholars are planning to greet the announcement of any trade deal as a \u201cday of national humiliation\u201d, a reference to the 19th century when foreign powers dominated China. Front-loading reforms offers some insulation: the government can portray the deal as a ratification of what it was already doing.\n\nBut domestic politicking also sheds light on why the trade talks have hit a rocky patch. China has more incentive to take a harder line at this moment\u2014just when a deal seems to be within reach. Sending Mr Trump into a frenzy on Twitter may worry investors. But to Chinese officials it looks like Mr Xi is driving a tougher bargain.\n\nComplicating matters, negotiations have been conducted in English, with the draft agreement (reportedly seven chapters and 150 pages) also in English. As it is translated into Chinese and circulated among more officials, changes are inevitable. \u201cYou can\u2019t really renege on something that is a non-binding work in progress,\u201d says James Zimmerman, a partner in the Beijing office of Perkins Coie, a law firm.\n\nChina still wants to avoid a full-fledged trade war. Should America raise tariffs, China\u2019s initial preference will be to continue with limited retaliation, says Wang Yong, director of the Centre for International Political Economy at Peking University. The American economy would, he thinks, suffer enough damage for Mr Trump to change course. If not, China\u2019s fight-back could get much nastier.", "_id": "b900cfba-c4a6-4d59-811e-a1681604b201"}
