Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the House Democratic Caucus chairman, said. \u201cThey were successful, and that\u2019s also what the Mueller report shows.\u201d\n\nFBI OPENED OBSTRUCTION CASE AGAINST TRUMP BEFORE MUELLER WAS APPOINTED, COURT FILES SHOW\n\n\u201cThis is not a politically inspired witch hunt,\u201d he added.\n\nRepublicans at the session, meanwhile, expressed their anger at what they described as a politically motivated push by Democrats unhappy at the conclusions of Mueller\u2019s report and worried about efforts to probe the origins of the Russia investigation itself.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s all about trying to destroy Bill Barr because Democrats are nervous he\u2019s going to get to the bottom of everything,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to find out how and why this investigation started in the first place.\u201d\n\nTRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO BLOCK RELEASE OF UNREDACTED MUELLER REPORT\n\nMueller\u2019s investigation did not find evidence of collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Russian government, though it detailed \"links\" between the two.\n\n\u201c[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,\u201d the special counsel report stated.\n\n\u201cWhile the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe probe did not come to a conclusion on the separate question of whether Trump obstructed justice.\n\nBut Democrats have pointed to numerous instances Mueller identified of possible obstruction, as well as contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russians, as cause for future investigations -- with a number of House Democrats and 2020 presidential hopefuls calling for impeachment hearings.\n\nHouse Judiciary Democrats have subpoenaed the full unredacted report, as well as the underlying evidence Mueller used to come to his conclusions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut the DOJ has rebuffed those demands. The White House announced on Wednesday that President Trump has asserted executive privilege over those documents.\n\n\"Faced with Chairman Nadler\u2019s blatant abuse of power, and at the Attorney General\u2019s request, the President has no other option than to make a protective assertion of executive privilege,\u201d press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "_id": "bf14ecd8-0724-4168-a732-b478bb24ef20"}
