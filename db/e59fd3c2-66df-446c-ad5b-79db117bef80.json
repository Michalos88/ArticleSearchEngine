(1:20)\n\nAnyone who watched Quinnen Williams during the 2018 college football season could tell you that he will be good in the NFL. Those types of players are no-brainers on Day 1 of the draft.\n\nIt's Days 2 and 3, though, where NFL front offices have to dig deep to show off their scouting chops. Getting not only roster depth but also impact starters from those picks is what builds championship-caliber teams.\n\nThese are the players drafted in the third round or later during the 2019 NFL draft who the crew at Pro Football Focus thinks deserve more attention.\n\nJohnson was one of the college football's most electric players, leading the nation with a 19.9-yard punt return average his last two seasons. The Toledo product had some drop issues this past season (eight drops on 57 catchable targets), but in 2017, when Logan Woodside was throwing him the football, Johnson had the fourth-highest receiving grade in college football. He's a precise route runner and one of the best after-the-catch threats in the draft.", "_id": "e59fd3c2-66df-446c-ad5b-79db117bef80"}
