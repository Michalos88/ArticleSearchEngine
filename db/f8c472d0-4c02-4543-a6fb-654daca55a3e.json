We\u2019ll make it worth your while.\n\nThe world\u2019s dominant e-commerce player is in talks with big American publishers, including the New York Times and BuzzFeed, about deals that would reward them for expanding their international presence, specifically in consumer-oriented shopping sites.\n\nAmazon already pays internet publishers that refer shoppers to the company via \u201caffiliate links\u201d embedded on their site, but it thinks that business could grow significantly if US publishers had more readers outside of America.\n\nRight now, publishers are paid when a shopper clicks on a link on their site, heads to Amazon, and eventually buys something. But sources say Amazon has been proposing various deals that would give publishers money up front in order to expand their international sites or open up new markets.\n\nIf any of the deals get finalized, they will mark a new chapter for Amazon: While other tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have paid publishers in advance to make specific kinds of videos or other content, Amazon hasn\u2019t been in that business before.\n\nIt\u2019s also an indicator that even though Amazon dominates online commerce, it still thinks it needs help getting shoppers inside its giant site. While Amazon is the place shoppers go to find something specific \u2014 it is increasingly challenging Google in the search results race as shoppers head directly to Amazon to look up a specific item \u2014 affiliate links can drive shoppers to stuff that Amazon is particularly interested in selling or that shoppers may not have known they could get from Amazon.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money Amazon is talking about \u2014 though it\u2019s enough for several publishers to take seriously \u2014 and which markets the company is most interested in. Also unclear: Whether Amazon would be flat-out underwriting publishers\u2019 expansions or if it would expect to get paid back via revenue the affiliate links generate.\n\nAmazon is specifically interested in publishers that have built up significant affiliate link units and would be paying them to build out those groups. That includes BuzzFeed, which has made e-commerce a significant part of its revenue strategy and has hired a team of writers to create shopping-friendly content; the Times, which bought the Wirecutter shopping guide for around $30 million in 2016; and New York Media, which has turned New York Magazine\u2019s \u201cStrategist\u201d shopping section into a meaningful part of its online business mix.\n\nReps from Amazon, BuzzFeed, the Times, and New York Media declined to comment.\n\nAffiliate links aren\u2019t a new idea (Vox Media sites also participate), but they\u2019ve taken on additional importance for publishers that are struggling to compete against Facebook and Google for online ad revenue.\n\nHere\u2019s how they generally work: A publisher mentions or recommends a particular product and includes a link to Amazon or another shopping site where a consumer can go to buy it. If a shopper heads there directly from the publisher\u2019s site, the shopping site will reward the publisher by giving it a percentage of the total \u201cbasket\u201d of goods the shopper ends up buying.\n\nIndustry sources say those percentages vary depending on the publication, shopping site, and the kind of goods, but can average around 10 percent for publishers that generate real volume.\n\nPublishers I\u2019ve talked to about Amazon\u2019s discussions say they\u2019re not uncomfortable contemplating taking money from Jeff Bezos and company (again, it\u2019s not a new idea for a tech company to steer some of its enormous resources to a media company). But they are aware that taking money from a giant tech company means you have to be aware that the tech company\u2019s needs and strategy can change, which means they can\u2019t expect Amazon to underwrite them forever.\n\nRecode and Vox have joined forces to uncover and explain how our digital world is changing \u2014 and changing us.
